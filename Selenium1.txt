actiTIME is the wevsites to practice web application .
close() is use for parent window and quit() use for parent and all other window.
use Taskmanager to view how much appliaction is running in background 

CSS expresion = tagname[attribute name='attribute value']
img[class='abc']

x path = xml path 
ctrl + f for search name 

CSS expresion      =   tagname[attribute name='attribute value']
xpath by attribute = //tagname[@AttributeName='AttributeValue']
xpath by name      = //tagname[text()='textvalue']
xpath by contains  = //tagname[contains(@AttributeName,'partialAttributeValue')]
                     //tagname[contains(text(),'patialtextvalue')]

independent & dependent = fixed element & dynamic    // one fix one dynamic
:-1) indentify which is fixed and dynamic
  2) write the xpath for fixed element
  3) update same xpath by backward traversing(/..) to find common parent bet two element
  4) update xpath by write xpath for dynamic element


independent & dependent = fixed element & dynamic    // two fix one dynamic
:-1) xpath fixed element 1
  2) backword drivarseing
   
  3) xpath fixed element 2
  4) back driversing
  5) xpath for dynamic element

xpath by Axes = fixed element/axis name::tagname[predicate]/<tr>- parent

xpath by group index value = (xpath)[index value]  // when we are not getting 1 0f 1 element then we go for xpath by group

(       xpath                                       )[index value]


one of one element :-
===============
<div class="xtXmba">Grocery</div>
<div class="xtXmba">Mobiles &amp; Tablets</div>
<div class="xtXmba">Flights</div>
<img loading="lazy" class="_396cs4" alt="TVs &amp; Appliances" src="https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/fk-p-flap/128/128/image/904f3c8e7101408b.png?q=100">

button[class='L0Z3Pu']
//div[text()='Grocery
//div[text()='Mobiles
===============

getAtrribute(); ==  to get atrribute value 

Synchronization is the process of matching application loading speed and automation script execution speed.
if we are not matching speed we get exception  = no such element exception  


implicite wait  / intellegent wait :- it also do code optimization(decrease the code lines) and it is save the time. 
 its only worked for :- 1) findElemnt()
                        2) findElements()


expilicite wait :- create webdriver object.

                   if condition is true it will execute next line ,
                   if condition is false it will stops the execution for further lines,we will get (TimeoutExecution).


Thread.sleep  / blind wait :- because it is blindly wait till milisecond we are provide 
fluent wait
page load time out 


Select Class :- To Handle the Drop Down action we use Select Class .

Action Class :- whatever action we do with mouse all action we do in action class.
                1) create object of Action
                2) In the action constructor we need to pass brouser reff varible as an action
                3) with the reff varible we need to call non static methods 

JavaScript :- 1) in selenuim is use for Scrolling action for Scroll Up and Scroll Down .

                  A)ScrollBy()
                  B)ScrollTo()

              2) To work on Disabled button.

Method Of JavaScript :- 1) Execute Script(String,Object)
                        2) ExecuteAsynchScript()

POPUp :- It is a GUI window which is come on the Top

Type :- JavaScript POPUP 
        HidenDivision POPUP :- when we do any action on web page the it ocours is called ias HiddenDivision
        Authentication POPUP :- https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth
                                we can pass the user name and password with the url to handle the popup.
        NOtification POPUP :- DEvelopers design this popup,To ask the permission from the user.
                            1) Avoid 
                            2) Handle
                            
        ChromeOPtion is needed


CHecks =         
         1) Inspectable or Not. // HiddenDivision is only inspectable popup 
         2) Any solution is there in your programming laungauge
         3) Any solution is there in your Automation Tool ( Selenium )
         4) Third Party Tool 
         5) Avoid the POpup
